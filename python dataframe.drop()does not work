When I try to remove some feature of columns,I use drop.function as bellow:

df.drop(columns=['the label of column i want to remove'])

and then I print the result, but this dataframe does not change.

The corrcet function is :
df = df.drop(columns=['the label of column i want to remove'])

and then it works!!!!!!!
